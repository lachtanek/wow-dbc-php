 * This example shows how to create a DBC-file from scratch using DBC mappings
 */

// File we'll be using in this example
$file = './dbcs/Sample.dbc';

// Load map from given INI-file (ensure read-access)
$map = DBCMap::fromINI('./maps/Sample.ini');

// Attempt to create a new DBC at given path (ensure write-access) with given map
$dbc = DBC::create($file, $map);

// Adding a single record
$dbc->add(1, 'John', 100, 1.80, 2, 0);

// Adding multiple records in one call
$dbc->add(array(2, 'Tim', 1337, 1.80, 1, 0), array(3, 'Pete', -10, 1.55, 1, 2));

// Failing to match the defined fields in the map (six, in this example) will silently and gracefully continue
// The following will leave 100, 200, 0, 'Hello' out of the actual record
$dbc->add(11, 'I am providing too many fields', 123, 1.20, 0, 0, 100, 200, 0, 'Hello');
// The following will append 0, 0, 0, 0 to the actual record
$dbc->add(12, 'I am providing too little fields');

// Setting up a collection of records
$records = array();
$records[] = array(4, 'Helen',	100,	1.80,	0,	0);

// Adding a collection of records in bulk
