// Construct a new (empty) DBC mapping
$map = new DBCMap();

// Add 'id' field (defaults to unsigned integer)
$map->add('id');

// Add 'name' as a string field (Use DBC::STRING_LOC for a localized string)
$map->add('name', DBC::STRING);

// Add 'points' as a signed integer field
$map->add('points', DBC::INT);

// Add 'height' as a float field
$map->add('height', DBC::FLOAT);

// Add 'friend1' and 'friend2' as signed integer fields
$map->add('friend', DBC::INT, 2);

// Add a random field
$map->add('remove-me');

// And remove it again
$map->remove('remove-me');

var_dump($map);

// Write the mappings to given INI-file
$map->toINI('./maps/Sample.ini');

// Open the given DBC (ensure read-access) with the aforementioned map
$dbc = new DBC('./dbcs/Sample.dbc', $map);

// Reference to the first record
$record = $dbc->getRecord(0);

// Getting name as a string according to mapping
echo $record->get('name');

// Getting height as a float according to mapping
echo $record->get('height');

// Setting height as a float according to mapping
$record->set('height', 1.80);
