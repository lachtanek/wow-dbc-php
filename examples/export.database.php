// Open given DBC and given map (ensure read-access on both)
$dbc = new DBC('./dbcs/Sample.dbc', DBCMap::fromINI('./maps/Sample.ini'));

// Set up a new database exporter
$dbe = new DBCDatabaseExporter();

// And instruct it to export the given DBC to the default table 'dbc' (ensure the DBC has an attached map)
$dbe->export($dbc);

// Alternatively supports exporting to a file by providing a second argument
$dbe->export($dbc, './export/sample.sql');

// If you would rather export to a specific table, pass in a third parameter
$dbe->export($dbc, './export/sample.sql', 'my_table');
